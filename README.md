Introduction

The Student Management System is a simple Python application built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and JSON for data storage.
It allows users to add, search, and view student records efficiently. Each student record includes a roll number, name, and marks, which are stored persistently in a JSON file.

The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and GUI design in Python. It provides a user-friendly interface where data can be managed without using a database, making it ideal for small-scale record management tasks.\
